## About data 
This dataset contains information about the students academic and training and placement status.

CGPA - It is the overall grades achieved by the student.

Internships - It tells the number of internships a student has done.

Projects - Number of projects a student has done.

Workshops/Certifications - As there are multiple courses available online student opt for them to upskill themselves.

ApptitudeTestScore - Aptitude test are generally a part of the recruitment process to understand the Quant and logical thinking of the student.

SoftSkillrating - Communication is a key role that plays in the placement or in any aspect of the life.

ExtraCurricularActivities - This helps provide and insight about the personality of an individual regarding how much he is active other than the academic.

PlacementTraining - It is provided to students in college to ace the placement process.

SSC and HSC - Senior Secondary and Higher Secondary Marks.

PlacementStatus - This is our target column with two classes placed and not placed.

## About the project 

I have made a Data Science project using a Kaggle dataset.

ðŸ”¥ Agenda : In this project we are using Logistic Regression from scratch(without using libraries) to predict a candidate will be placed or not. 

 ðŸ”¥ Method : 
 
ðŸŽ¯ First we see that data has no null values

ðŸŽ¯ Then we find correlation matrix and select highly correlated features .

ðŸŽ¯ We use logistic regression model to predict the Placement Status of the candidate we save the model in a file.

ðŸŽ¯ We plot a graph of cost of logistic regression vs. iterations which tells us how cost is decreasing over iterations.

ðŸŽ¯ Finally we get a logistic regression model predicting the placement status of a candidate without using any inbuilt libraries.

ðŸ”¥ Conclusion : We can predict the PlacementStatus of a candidate with 79.5 Accuracy and 73.48 Precision.
